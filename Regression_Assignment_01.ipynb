    "**`Assumptions of Linear Regression` :-** Linear regression, despite its simplicity, relies on several crucial assumptions for obtaining valid and reliable results. Understanding and checking these assumptions are essential before interpreting your model. Here are the key assumptions :-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Relationship:** The underlying relationship between the independent and dependent variables must be linear. This means a straight line best represents the trend in the data. Visualize the data with a scatter plot to assess linearity. Look for curved patterns, clusters, or outliers that deviate from a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence of Errors:** Each data point's error (difference between predicted and actual value) should be independent of others. This means there's no pattern or correlation between errors. Checking for autocorrelation with residual plots like time series plots or Durbin-Watson test can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In simpler terms, the \"spread\" of errors shouldn't change as the predictor variable changes. Analyze residual plots against the independent variable or use tests like Breusch-Pagan test to detect heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of Errors:** Ideally, the errors should be normally distributed around zero. This allows for reliable statistical inferences based on the model's coefficients. Histograms, Q-Q plots, and Shapiro-Wilk test can help assess normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Multicollinearity:** The independent variables shouldn't be highly correlated with each other. If they are, it can inflate the variance of the coefficients and make their interpretation challenging. Look for high correlations among the independent variables and consider variable selection techniques if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Endogeneity:** There shouldn't be a causal relationship between the error term and the independent variables. This means other factors not included in the model shouldn't influence both the independent and dependent variables. Careful model design and understanding the underlying domain knowledge can help mitigate this issue."
